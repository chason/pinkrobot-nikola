.. title: Displaying JSON Data as a Table using Flask
.. slug: displaying-json-data-as-a-table-using-flask

`WordCamp SF`_ is coming up in just a few days, and that means its time to meet
a bunch of new people. I hate going to these things blind, so last year I wrote
a small Python script to go through the list of attendees, extract their
website, and run a WHOIS search on their IP to find out who their website host
was.

This was useful at the time to get a read on the upcoming crowd and see
approximately how many customers we had who were attending, and how many our
competitors had. Unfortunately it wasn’t nearly as useful once we were there.
I wanted to do something similar this year, but instead of getting statistics
on the attendees as a whole I decided to get some data on the individuals.

.. TEASER_END

I decided not to do the WHOIS information this year because the information was
unreliable, difficult to scrape, and not very useful in the end. Since WordCamp
provides the website and Twitter handles of the attendees (if they choose to
provide it), I figured the best metrics would be the Google PageRank of their
website and the Klout_ score associated with their Twitter handle. Say what you
will about the validity or importance of these ratings but at a conference for
blogging software, they’re somewhat relevant.

Scraping the Data
-----------------

I began working out a program to get this information, but this was my first
time using the lxml_ library and I overcomplicated the design. When I got
frustrated with this, I just started hacking away in IPython_. I ended up using
requests_ retrieving the page, lxml to parse the HTML, PyKlout_ to get the
Klout data, and the Python script from Phurix’s `collection of PageRank scripts`_.

I didn’t want to throw this data into a database because I’m lazy and didn’t
feel like writing out a schema. Instead, I wrote out my Python object to a file
encoded in JSON_. Of course, this wasn’t very interesting because while I had
my data it was not very accessible.

JSON to Flask
-------------

So I decided to use Flask_ to create a webpage out of the data. I used Flask
because I’d had my eye on it for a while as a really cool web micro-framework.
This problem is pretty simple, but Flask did an amazing job not getting in my
way which is what you really want in a micro-framework. Here’s what the
application code looked like:

.. gist:: 6154188

Obviously, there’s plenty more I can do. Right now the data is only sorted by
the Klout score, but it wouldn’t be that difficult to fix that and add
pagination as well.

I’m going to be doing some more stuff with this in a few days, but I thought
this might be useful for anyone else that has some JSON data they need to
quickly see in a table.
