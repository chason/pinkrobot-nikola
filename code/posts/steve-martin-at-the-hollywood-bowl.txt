Tonight I got to see `Steve Martin`_ in concert at the `Hollywood Bowl`_. While I was
expecting a great show, I was really blown away. Not only did he have incredibly
entertaining banter in between songs, not only did he have a hugely talented
backup band (`Steep Canyon Rangers`_), but he also showed off his chops as a
talented musician who has been playing and mastering his instrument for fifty
years.

Also not to be missed was `Edie Brickell`_ assisting on the songs from their
latest album, `Love Has Come For You`_. Her saucy, rich voice complimented
his banjo and made for a wonderful evening.

This was my first time at the Hollywood Bowl, and I was very impressed. It is
a beautiful venue set in the Hollywood Hills just north of Hollywood Blvd. Set
inside a valley, its size makes it feel like a geographic landmark. Additionally,
the venue lets people bring in their own food and drink which is a great touch.

While you won't be able to see him at the Hollywood Bowl again for the time
being, if you have a chance to catch him during this tour I highly recommend it.
